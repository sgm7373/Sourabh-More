## 🧑‍💻 Experience  

### Graduate Researcher – FEM & Data Analysis  
*Oregon State University (Jan 2024 – Present)*  
- Built **3D racket–shuttle impact models** in Siemens NX & Abaqus/Explicit (linear elastic, hyperelastic, viscoelastic).  
- Performed **mesh & time-step convergence studies** (<5% error thresholds).  
- Automated **stress/strain extraction, tensor analysis, and post-processing dashboards**.  
- Applied **persistence homology & Reeb graphs** to stress/strain fields; benchmarked Lp-norm features vs rebound stability.  

### Data Analyst Intern – Nirmitee Consultants  
*(Mar 2022 – May 2023)*  
- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **statistical modeling** for efficiency optimization.  
- Developed **Power BI dashboards** using DAX queries to visualize material usage and project metrics.  
- Implemented **data wrangling, anomaly detection, and GIS/CAD integration**.
